# smart-crop-irrigation-using-iot-and-machine-learning-for-optimized-water-usage
This project is based on to provide efficient water to the crops and we are using the iot sensors such as soil moisture sensor,temperature sensor and humidity sensor and we also machine learning algorithms for predicting the irrigation
